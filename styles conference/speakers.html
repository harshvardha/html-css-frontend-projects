                <h4 class="tag-line">designing a culture of design</h4>
                <p class="description">
                    Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn’t end
                    with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the
                    motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a workforce. For design to be
                    most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design
                    and
                    allows it to succeed.
                    <br><br>
                    In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design,
                    both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others
                    don’t,
                    and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within
                    a
                    culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.

                <p class="description">
                    Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written
                    narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this together. To do
                    so they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize
                    information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.
                    <br><br>
                    With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical
                    aspects used in film to communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic
                    patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re used and how we might look to
                    them for inspiration.

                <h4 class="tag-line">(you should be) testing your javascript</h4>
                <p class="description">
                    JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested libraries like jQuery, AngularJS,
                    Backbone.js and more, but how can we be sure that our code is ready for production? This talk will
                    share tips on how writing tests can be written easily and quickly and how to remove buggy code
                    through testing.

                <p class="description">
                    Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little better
                    by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions.
                    Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases
                    collaboration and improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.
